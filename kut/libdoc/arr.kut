/// Array functions.
///
/// Beside the functions described below, array also allows:
///
/// Subindex (A[ix])
///   - Returns the element in position 'ix'.
///   - If 'ix >= arr.len(A)' or 'ix < 0' a fail is raised.
/// Subarrays at left (A[:ix]), at right (A[ix:]) and between limits (A[i:j]).
/// These subarrays are shallow copies of the original.
///   - If subindices are '< 0', they are converted en 'len(A) + i'.
///   - If the final value is '< 0' or '>= len(A)', a fail is raised.
///   - In case of 's[i, j]', if 'j < i', a fail is raised.
///   - The expresion 'A[:]' returns a shallow copy of 'A' (althoug 'arr.copy'
///   - is more efficient.

/// Returns 'true' if fn returns true with every element of 'it'.
